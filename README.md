# About LLofMH

In each age, there are those who dwell closest to the Most High.  And out of those, there are a handful who bring him many souls, much glory thru works, and their willingness to sacrifice anything asked of them by God, Most High. And of those few the Lord selects those who can handle the role of a hero of that age. those whose names we read today in the Bible were the heros of the last age.If they were still alive today they  would be Living Legends of the Most High. 

What if I told you that on Earth today right now there are saints and prophets whose lives appear to track scripture  with eerie 'coincidences', written long before their birth. These few made mighty by the LIVING GOD and vested with his spirit and power and speaking his mind thru them to humanity so that they might know the mind of God.  

The Creator, exalts his champions as he sees fit. He makes them into  LIVING LEGENDS of the MOST HIGH. 

Generally, all of us have put in years of work for the Most  High. We spend more time thinking about and conversing with the Most High than anything else. We all have a personal relationship with him of a very profound nature. We are his judges, his prophets, his seers, his saints, his martyrs, his warriors, his evangelists, and his witnesses.

Only those with a legend documented in scripture or texts that can be  shown to have been written prior to their birth,  prophesying their birth and life which are indisputable facts which refer to said specific individual unambiguously and correctly. However those are just guidelines. It is such that the Most High informs and confirms. It is his choice from beginning to end 

Does he emblazon LIVING LEGEND as a title upon them in heaven and they are made officials in the divine counsel of God and immediately they are included as a full member of our LIVING LEGENDS of the MOST HIGH which is both an organization and an individuals' title.
